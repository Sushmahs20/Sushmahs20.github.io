    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      As a data science graduate with a strong foundation in advanced analytics, predictive modeling, and cloud computing, I am passionate about transforming complex datasets into actionable insights that drive impactful business decisions. My expertise spans the development of intelligent data systems, optimization of data processes, and the application of machine learning algorithms to solve real-world challenges.

I hold an MSc in Applied Data Science from the University of Essex, where I developed a deep understanding of data-driven methodologies, AI frameworks, and statistical modeling. My professional journey includes internships at DataWeave and HiveMinds, where I applied my skills to optimize data workflows, enhance marketing strategies, and automate data processing systems.

In addition, I have contributed to multiple publications in medical imaging, such as anomaly detection in mammograms and ensemble learning techniques for enhanced diagnostic accuracy. As part of my Master's thesis, I collaborated with Pole Star Global, a leading maritime company, where I developed predictive models to enhance maritime safety through real-time ship location tracking and anomaly detection.

I am proficient in Python, R, SQL, JavaScript, AWS, and Tableau, along with a solid understanding of databases, ETL frameworks, and data visualization. I thrive in applying AI solutions and predictive analytics to deliver insights that enable businesses to make informed, data-driven decisions.

I am now eager to apply my skills in data science and AI to innovative projects that drive business success and technological advancement, while continuously seeking opportunities to expand my expertise and contribute to cutting-edge solutions.
