    <strong>Data Engineer Intern</strong>, DataWeave (Nov 2022 - Jun 2023) - Bangalore, India<br>
    I was responsible for building and maintaining scalable ETL pipelines to automate the collection, transformation, and storage of large datasets from diverse sources. My work ensured high data quality, consistency, and availability for analytics teams. I optimized database performance by working with both SQL and NoSQL technologies, and I developed Python scripts to streamline data processing tasks. This role required close collaboration with product and business teams to understand data requirements and deliver meaningful insights, further enhancing my skills in working with large-scale data systems and creating efficient, automated solutions.

  <li>
    <strong>Marketing Data Analyst Intern</strong>, HiveMinds (Mar 2021 - May 2021) - Bangalore, India<br>
    During my time at HiveMinds, I provided actionable insights to improve digital marketing strategies for key clients. I analyzed SEO and SEM campaign performance data using Google Analytics and created interactive dashboards that visualized key metrics to inform optimization strategies. By monitoring user behavior, conversion rates, and advertising spend, I helped enhance overall campaign effectiveness. This role strengthened my ability to connect data analysis with business outcomes, communicate findings to stakeholders, and support strategic decision-making in a fast-paced marketing environment.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Software Development Intern</strong>, XonLabs (Aug 2020 - Sep 2020) - Bangalore, India<br>
    I contributed to both backend development using Java and frontend interface design with HTML and CSS, collaborating with cross-functional teams to ensure seamless user experiences. This experience enhanced my technical foundation in data processing, user interaction design, and applying machine learning concepts to real-world problems, which are valuable in delivering innovative solutions in data-centric environments.
